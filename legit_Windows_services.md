# Windows knowledge

This page aims at documenting legitimate Windows services and programs, meaning those that one can expect to find on a regular Windows box.

**Please note** that, during an investigation, if there is any chance that a code injection happened (using API, or even DLL load order hijack), then one or more of those services might be malicious though, because their code was modified in-memory!
The check should then be done at an execution context level, with surrounding processes (and their associated privileges), and behaviour detection-like approach.

| WinHttpAutoProxySvc | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted -p | Should be active or on demand | Manual | WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service | WinHTTP implements the client HTTP stack and provides developers with a Win32 API and COM Automation component for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses. In addition, WinHTTP provides support for autodiscovering a proxy configuration via its implementation of the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol. 
Anything that uses the network stack can have a functional dependency on this service. Many organizations rely on WinHTTPAutoProxySvc to configure their internal networks' HTTP proxy routing. Without it, internally originating HTTP connections to the Internet fail. |
| dot3svc | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p | Could be active | Manual | Wired AutoConfig | The Wired AutoConfig (DOT3SVC) service is responsible for performing IEEE 802.1X authentication on Ethernet interfaces. If your current wired network deployment enforces 802.1X authentication, the DOT3SVC service should be configured to run for establishing Layer 2 connectivity and/or providing access to network resources. Wired networks that don't enforce 802.1X authentication are unaffected by the DOT3SVC service. |
| WLANSVC | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p | Could be active | Manual | WLAN Autoconfig | The WLANSVC service provides the logic required to configure, discover, connect to, and disconnect from a wireless local area network (WLAN) as defined by IEEE 802.11 standards. WLANSVC service also contains the logic to turn your computer into a software access point so that other devices or computers can connect to your computer wirelessly. Stopping or disabling the WLANSVC service make all WLAN adapters on your computer inaccessible from the Windows networking UI. Disabling WLANSVC isn't recommended if your computer has a WLAN adapter. |
| wmiApSrv | C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\WmiApSrv.exe | Should be active or on demand | Manual | WMI Performance Adapter | Provides performance library information from Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) providers to clients on the network. This service only runs when Performance Data Helper is activated. |
| workfolderssvc | C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalService -p | Could be active | Automatic | Work Folders | This service syncs files with the Work Folders server, enabling you to use the files in Work Folders. |
| LanmanWorkstation | C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k NetworkService -p | Should be active | Automatic | Workstation | Creates and maintains client network connections to remote servers using the SMB protocol. If this service is stopped, these connections are unavailable. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it fails to start. |
| WwanSvc | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted -p | Could be active | Manual | WWAN AutoConfig | This service manages mobile broadband (GSM & CDMA) data card/embedded module adapters and connections by autoconfiguring the networks. Disabling WwanSvc isn't recommended for best user experience of mobile broadband devices. |
| XboxGipSvc | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p | Might be active | Manual | Xbox Accessory Management Service | This service manages connected Xbox Accessories. |
| XblAuthManager | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p | Might be active | Manual | Xbox Live Auth Manager | Provides authentication and authorization services for interacting with Xbox Live. If this service is stopped, some applications don't operate correctly. |
| XblGameSave | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p | Might be active | Manual | Xbox Live Game Save | This service syncs save data for Xbox Live save enabled games. If this service is stopped, game save data doesn't upload to or download from Xbox Live. |
| XboxNetApiSvc | C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p | Might be active | Manual | Xbox Live Networking Service | This service supports the Windows.Networking.XboxLive application programming interface. |
